# airports-derby
This assignemnt is part of a pair of assignments we have been tasked to do in a class, where we perform CRUD operations on a database of Airport objects, and the GUI displays the content of the database. This assignment must connect to a Derby database and prefurm CRUD operations directly in SQL. The other assignement uses REST to connect to a server.
The app was written in Java and the GUI uses Swing. The Derby database must be set up set up separately and the connection string added to the Datalayer.java file before compiling. Use the Airports.sql script to create the table in the database.
Once the software is set up, airports data can be entered in the graphical interface and added to the database using "Add New." Airports can be modified using "Update" or deleted using "Delete." When an airport is selected, the app will find the nearest airport using "Find Nearest Airport" and display the distance. The algorithm for calculating distances was obtained from GeoDataSource.
